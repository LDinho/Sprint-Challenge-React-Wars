1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

- React is a JS library that helps build JS driven front-end web apps. It runs in the browser making a react app run faster, performance wise, for the user. And React makes it easier to create web apps split into components - having separate components help in maintaining large codebases. React is open source. And one problem it tries to solve is the handling of UI state. React makes it easier to manage state dynamically.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

- It means to think of your UI as smaller pieces and React elements that can be divided up into code blocks called components.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

 - A class component holds state, has a constructor function and `super()`, and needs a render function, whereas a functional component does not -- but simply returns and displays elements.

1.  Describe state.

 - State is the data that our React components have access to.

1.  Describe props.

 - When we pass state around via components, we call it props (short for properties) and they are immutable.
